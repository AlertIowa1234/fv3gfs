G\+M\+TB has developed a Single Column Model (S\+CM) for the purpose of testing physical parameterizations in an environment that is model agnostic. Currently the S\+CM uses the G\+FS time-\/stepping and vertical grid to run idealized cases, and it can be modified to include other schemes.

The implementation of the I\+PD in the Single Column Model allows developers who wish to incorporate and evaluate physics changes using the I\+PD to do so in a simplified framework independent of a full forecast system. It may also bring insight into the implementation of the I\+PD for those developers who wish to implement it within their dycore.
